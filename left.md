**ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:**
- Analyze the user's clothing color, style, and type from their provided image
- Select background gradient based on clothing color contrast:
  - Dark clothing (black, navy, dark colors) → Choose from: (light variants)
  - Light clothing (white, cream, pastels) → Choose from: (dark variants)
  - Bright/Colorful clothing → Choose from: Gray/Silver/White or complementary color gradients
- Select text colors that provide maximum contrast with chosen background:
  - Dark backgrounds → Use bright colors 
  - Light backgrounds → Use dark colors 
  - Colorful backgrounds → Use white or black based on background darkness
- Maintain the exact clothing style and color from the user's image

**Text Color Selection Based on Background:**

**For Dark Backgrounds (Purple, Dark Blue, Red, Black gradients):**
- Main Title Colors: #FFFFFF (white), #F7DF1E (bright yellow), #61DAFB (cyan), #4FC08D (green), #FF6B6B (coral)
- Secondary Text: bright accent colors
- Outlines: Black or very dark colors for definition

**For Light Backgrounds (White, Light Gray, Light Blue gradients):**
- Main Title Colors: #000000 (black), #333333 (dark gray), #DD0031 (red), #3776AB (blue), #2D3748 (dark slate)
- Secondary Text: (dark colors)
- Outlines: White or light colors for definition

**For Bright/Colorful Backgrounds (Yellow, Orange, Green gradients):**
- Assess background brightness and choose contrasting white or black
- Use complementary colors for maximum impact
- Ensure text readability with proper outline colors

**Background Selection Examples:**
- Examples 1: User wearing dark navy shirt → Choose "Bright yellow halftone radial" or "Light blue sky gradient"
- Examples 2: User wearing white shirt → Choose "Purple neon speed lines radiating outward" or "Dark red to maroon gradient"
- Examples 3: User wearing bright red shirt → Choose "Deep blue ocean gradient" or "Silver metallic radial gradient"
- Examples 4: User wearing light gray shirt → Choose "Forest green radial gradient" or "Wine red radial gradient"

**Critical Rules:**
1. Output ONLY the JSON structure - no additional text
2. NEVER change user's clothing - match exactly from their image
3. Always select background that contrasts with user's clothing color
4. Always select text colors that have maximum contrast with chosen background
5. Specify exact gradient selection and reasoning in background section
6. Ensure text readability is the top priority - never use similar color families for background and text
7. Use clean gradient backgrounds with subtle patterns, never code screenshots
8. Maintain shoulder-up crop for professional appearance
9. Ensure ultra-high impact typography with proper contrasting brand colors

Example for user wearing dark blue shirt:
{
  "main_title": {
    "color": "#F7DF1E",
    "effects": "thick black outline + dramatic drop shadow"
  },
  "secondary_text": {
    "color": "#FFFFFF",
    "effects": "subtle black shadow for maximum contrast"
  },
  "background": {
    "type": "adaptive gradient based on user's clothing color contrast",
    "gradient": "White paper texture background - Design a clean white background with very subtle paper or fabric texture overlay",
    "selection_logic": "Dark blue clothing requires bright/light background for contrast"
  },
  "tech_stack": {
    "primary_logo": "[MAIN_TECHNOLOGY]",
    "icons": ["[TOOL_1]", "[TOOL_2]", "[TOOL_3]"],
    "arrangement": "clean circular layout with contrasting borders at bottom left",
    "size": "prominent but balanced with text hierarchy"
